# CryptSync personal version
This a fork of Stefan KÃ¼ng's [CryptSync](http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/CryptSync.html) with minor tweaks for my own personal use.
Installers signed with my PGP key can be downloaded on the [releases](https://github.com/cfbao/CryptSync/releases) page.

The [*Official*](https://github.com/cfbao/CryptSync/tree/official) branch is a clone of the official CryptSync source code as checked out from https://svn.code.sf.net/p/cryptsync-sk/code/trunk.

### Disclaimer
This fork does not intend to be a full fledged project in its own right.
It is purely for my personal use, and will closely follow CryptSync official updates.
It is published here in hope that it might happen to also be useful for others.
